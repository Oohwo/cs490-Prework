# CS490 Prework - Tip Calculator

## Description
The Tip Calculator is basically my first iOS Project since highschool! Simply enter your bill and voila! It automatically calculates your tip and adjusted total!

The project is an iOS application that I coded through Swift and XCode through my 2013 MacBook Pro. It's been around 5-6 years since I've developed an iOS Application but now that I'm taking CS490-iOS, I'm looking to sharpen my skills and have a lot of fun! Though the Tip Calculator is basically done, I plan to add more features as time permits. Looking forward to the rest of this semester! :)

## Roadmap
- [x] Waited 3-4 hours for my MacBook to update from Catalina to Big Sur
- [x] Waited another few hours to install XCode
- [x] Coded the basic foundation of the app in a few minutes
- [ ] Add more features (custom tip, more currencies, better graphics / receipt, and more) as time permits
- [ ] Edit README.md description to make it more personal I guess...???
